# IoT_Syringe-Pump
A syringe pump is a device that can accurately deliver small amounts of liquid. Syringe pumps are commonly used in hospitals for administering drugs intravenously and in labs for biological experiments. 

Syringe pump that is being equipped with IoT has a promising future as it could help in data transferring and distance controlling. Besides from medical application, this syringe pump could also be used in 3d printers which could be operated remotely. Syringe pump applied with IoT is indeed an interesting project.
